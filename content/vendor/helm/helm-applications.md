> This topic applies to both native Helm and Replicated Helm installations.

Some applications are already packaged as a Helm chart, and it's preferred to continue to use this archive to deliver to enterprise customers. 
In this form, it's common for the Helm chart to be the primary artifact that a Replicated application included, but to include the [HelmChart KOTS Custom Resources](/reference/v1beta1/helmchart/) separately.
