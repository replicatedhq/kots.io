## Using Built-In Fields

Built-In entitlement fields are referenced the nearly the same as you would for [Custom Entitlement Fields](/vendor/entitlements/custom-entitlements).  

* **Within application manifests**: Use the [LicenseFieldValue](/reference/template-functions/license-context) function to return the value of the corresponding built-in field (e.g., `value: '{{repl LicenseFieldValue "expires_at" }}'`
* **Within the application**: Execute an http request to `http://kotsadm:3000/license/v1/license` to return the license API response, then parse the response to find the return the corresponding license field value.
