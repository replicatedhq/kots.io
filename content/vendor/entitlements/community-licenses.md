KOTS applications that are packaged and delivered through the Replicated [Vendor Portal](https://vendor.replicated.com) include a [built-in entitlement](/vendor/entitlements/built-in-entitlements/) to indicate the type of license.
One of these options is `community`.
This document describes what a Community license is and what happens when using Community licenses in the Admin Console.

*Note: Not all accounts support Community Licenses. To enable this feature, contact [support@replicated.com](mailto:support@replicated.com).*

## Community vs Other License Types

A Replicated KOTS application includes some built-in entitlements, and additional support from the application vendor.
Community enabled licenses work the same as any other license, with a few small exceptions:

### No Airgapped Support
Community licenses cannot support airgapped installations.

### No Expiration
Community licenses cannot include an expiration date.

### Marking in the Admin Console
When a community license is installed, the Admin Console will indicate this to differentiate the experience.
The license tile on the Dashboard page contains the words "Community Edition" highlighted in yellow.

### Support Bundle
Because community licenses are not designed to include the same level of support as paid licenses, all support bundles and analysis in the Admin Console will be clearly marked as Community Edition.
The same functionality is included in the support bundle and analysis, there is just additional marking to help differentiate.
