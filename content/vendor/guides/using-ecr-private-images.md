KOTS supports working with private images stored in Amazon's Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

## Objective

The purpose of this guide is to walk you through a hello-world example on how to configure Replicated to pull images from a private registry in Amazon's Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

## Prerequisites & Assumptions

This power-user's guide assumes you have completed the [standard quickstart](https://kots.io/vendor/guides/quickstart/) or the [CLI quickstart](https://kots.io/vendor/guides/cli-quickstart/) guides as this guide is a continuation of those guides.
As with the previous guides, we will also need a VM to install the application with the following minimum requirements:

* Ubuntu 18.04
* At least 8 GB of RAM
* 4 CPU cores
* At least 40GB of disk space

In this guide we are going to focus on the difference between using a public image versus a private image in Replicated.
To do this, we'll pull the public ngnix container and then push it to a private repository in ECR.

This means we'll need:

* An ECR Repository
* An AWS Account to use with Docker to pull and push the public nginx image to the ECR repository
* Docker
* The AWS CLI

Later in the guide we'll configure Replicated to pull from the ECR repository using a read-only account.
To do this we'll need to make sure the above AWS account can also create this user.

## Overview

The guide is divided into the following steps:

 1. [Set Up Testing Environment](#1-set-up-testing-environment)

 2. [Configure Private Registries in Replicated](#2-configure-private-registries-in-replicated)

 3. [Update Definition Files](#3-update-definition-files)

 4. [Install the New Version](#4-install-the-new-version)

## 1. Set Up Testing Environment

For this guide, we are simply going to use the default nginx deployment to create our application and then update it to pull the same container from a private repository in ECR and note the differences.

### Create Sample Application and deploy the first release

In this section, we cover at a high level the steps to create a new application and install it on a VM. As mentioned earlier, it's assumed you have completed the [standard quickstart](https://kots.io/vendor/guides/quickstart/) or the [CLI quickstart](https://kots.io/vendor/guides/cli-quickstart/) guide, which cover these steps in detail.

To create our sample application follow these steps:

* Create a new application in Replicated and call it 'MySampleECRApp'.
* Create the first release using the default definition files and promote it to the *unstable* channel.
* Create a customer, assign it to the *Unstable* channel and download the license file after creating the customer.
* Install the application to a Virtual Machine

Log in to the admin console. To inspect what was deployed let's look at the files under **View Files**.
In the Upstream files (files from the Release created in the Replicated Vendor Portal) show that we are pulling the public image.

![admin-console-view-files-upstream-release1](/images/guides/kots/priv-reg-ecr-ups-files-rel1.png)

We can further validate this if we switch back to the terminal window on the VM where we installed the application.
If we run `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` on the nginx pod, we can confirm that it was in fact pulled from the public repository.

![admin-console-kubectl-describe-release2](/images/guides/kots/priv-reg-ecr-kubctl-describe-rel1.png)

Now that we have the basic application installed, we are now going to pull the same image but from an ECR repository.

### Pull Public Image and Push to ECR

To keep the changes to a minimum and only focus on using a private registry, we are going to pull the public nginx container (as specified in the `deployment.yaml` file) to our local environment, and then push it to a repository in ECR.
To use `docker login` with ECR, we will need to configure AWS CLI with the AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Key for this user.

Let's start by pulling the public image

```shell
$ docker pull nginx
```

You should have an output similar to this:

```shell
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/nginx
d121f8d1c412: Pull complete
ebd81fc8c071: Pull complete
655316c160af: Pull complete
d15953c0e0f8: Pull complete
2ee525c5c3cc: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:c628b67d21744fce822d22fdcc0389f6bd763daac23a6b77147d0712ea7102d0
Status: Downloaded newer image for nginx:latest
docker.io/library/nginx:latest
```

Next we need to login to ECR and push this container.
To use `docker login` with ECR we will need to [install the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) and  [configure it](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html) if not already.
As part of this, we will need to provide the AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Key for a user that has permissions to create and push images to the repository. Please refer to [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/getting-started-cli.html) if you are not familiar using the AWS CLI to work with containers and ECR.


Just like with any other private registry, we need to know the registry endpoint to pass the `docker login` command.
The syntax is as follows:

```shell

docker login [some.private.registry]:[port]

```
In this case, the endpoint is the **[some.private.registry]:[port]**

To determine the endpoint for ECR, login to the AWS console and seach for 'ECR', which should bring up Elastic Container Registry as an option as shown below.

![search-4-ecr](/images/guides/kots/priv-reg-ecr-search-4-ecr.png)

Select 'Elastic Container Registry' from the options in the dropdown to get to the list of repositories.

![ecr-repos](/images/guides/kots/priv-reg-ecr-repos.png)

As you can see from the screenshot above, you can see the endpoints for each repository under the URI column.
For the purpose of this guide, we will push the nginx image to the **demo-apps** repository.

To determine the endpoint to use in the login command, use the url without the repository name.

When it comes to loggin in to ECR, we need to use the AWS CLI to the user credentials.
As an example, to login to ECR we run the following command:

```shell

$ aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 4999999999999.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
```

A succesful login will display a `Login Succeeded` message.
In order to push this image to our private repsoitory, we need to tag the image.
The new tag will consist of:

`<ecr repoendpoint>/image`

As an example, to tag the public nginx image we run the following command:

```shell
$ docker tag nginx 4999999999999.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/demo-apps/nginx
```

Assuming a successful tag, we now push the container to our ECR repository

```shell
$ docker push 4999999999999.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/demo-apps/nginx      
The push refers to repository [4999999999999.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/demo-apps/nginx]
908cf8238301: Pushed
eabfa4cd2d12: Pushed
60c688e8765e: Pushed
f431d0917d41: Pushed
07cab4339852: Pushed
latest: digest: sha256:794275d96b4ab96eeb954728a7bf11156570e8372ecd5ed0cbc7280313a27d19 size: 1362

```
Our testing environment is all set!
We are now ready to update Replicated to use the private registry.

* * *

## 2. Configure Private Registries in Replicated

To configure a Private Registry in Replicated, we need to provide the same information we needed to login to ECR in the previous step:

- **Endpoint**
- **Username**
- **Password**

The difference is that we'll use a different user than the one we used previously. Since Replicated only needs to pull images, it is a best practice to create a 'read-only' user for this specific purpose.

### Determine the endpoint

The endpoint should be the same as the one we provided in the previous step.

### Setting up the Service Account User

Replicated only needs access to pull images from the private registry. Let's create a new user in AWS:

![aws-new-user](/images/guides/kots/priv-reg-ecr-new-user.png)

As far as permissions go, there are a couple of options, depending on scope of access.
If exposing all images to Replicated is an acceptable solution, the Amazon-provided [AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/ecr_managed_policies.html#AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly) policy will work:

```shell
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [{
		"Effect": "Allow",
		"Action": [
			"ecr:GetAuthorizationToken",
			"ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",
			"ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
			"ecr:GetRepositoryPolicy",
			"ecr:DescribeRepositories",
			"ecr:ListImages",
			"ecr:DescribeImages",
			"ecr:BatchGetImage"
		],
		"Resource": "*"
	}]
}
```
If you wish to limit Replicated to only certain images, this policy should be used instead:

```shell
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
		    "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",
		    "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
		    "ecr:GetRepositoryPolicy",
		    "ecr:DescribeRepositories",
		    "ecr:ListImages",
		    "ecr:DescribeImages",
		    "ecr:BatchGetImage"
        ],
        "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:ecr:us-east-1:<account-id>:repository/<repo1>",
            "arn:aws:ecr:us-east-1:<account-id>:repository/<repo2>"
        ]
    }]
}{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
    ]
}
```

We will need the AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Key in the next section as these will map to the *Username* and *Password* fields. You can obtain these as you create the user or after the user has been created.

### Enter Registry Information in Replicated

First, we must link Replicated with the registry. To do this, click on **Add External Registry** from the *Images* tab.

![vendor-web-new-registry](/images/guides/kots/priv-reg-ecr-link-new.png)

The values for the fields are:

**Endpoint:**
Enter the same URL used to login to ECR.
For example, to link to the same registry as the one in the section, we would enter *4999999999999.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com*.

**Username:**
Enter the AWS Access Key ID for the user created in the [Setting Up the Service Account User](#setting-up-the-service-account-user) section.

**Password:**
Enter the AWS Secret Key for the user created in the [Setting Up the Service Account User](#setting-up-the-service-account-user) section.

* * *

## 3. Update Definition Files

Last step is to update our defintion manifest to pull the image from the ECR repository.
To do this, we'll update the `deployment.yaml` file by adding the ECR registry URL to the `image` value.
Below is an example using the registry URL used in this guide.

```diff
	    spec:
	      containers:
	        - name: nginx
-	          image: nginx
+			  image: 4999999999999.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/demo-apps/nginx
	          envFrom:
```

Save your changes and create the new release and promote it to the *Unstable* channel.

* * *

## 4. Install the New Version

To deploy the new version of the application, go back to the Admin Console and select the *Version History* tab.
Click on **Check for Updates** and then **Deploy** when the new version is listed.

![version-history](/images/guides/kots/priv-reg-ecr-version-history.png)

When the new version is installed, the status shows as the currently deployed version.

Now, we can inspect to see the changes in the definition files.
Looking at the `deployment.yaml` upstream file, we see the image path as we set it in the [Update Definition Files](#3-update-definition-files) section.

![admin-console-view-files-upstream-release2](/images/guides/kots/priv-reg-ecr-upstream-file-rel2.png)

Since KOTS is able to detect that it can't pull this image anonymously, it then tries to proxy the private registries configured. Looking at the `kustomization.yaml` downstream file we can see that the image path is changed to use the Replicated proxy.

![admin-console-view-files-downstream-release2](/images/guides/kots/priv-reg-ecr-downstream-file-rel2.png)

The install of the new version should have created a new pod. If we run `kubectl describe pod` on the new nginx pod, we can confirm that the image was in fact pulled from the ECR repository.
