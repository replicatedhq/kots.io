When delivering a configurable KOTS application, the customer-supplied config values may result in optional Kubernetes manifests that are not needed for one environment. A common example of this is when a KOTS application includes a Postgres Statefulset, but provides a config option for the user to choose if they want to run that included Postgres, or bring their own managed or external Postgres instance.

In this scenario, when a customer chooses to bring their own component, you should not deploy the Postgres Statefulset. This can be can be accomplished using the Replicated [template functions](../template-functions/) and Kubernetes annotations in the related components.

## Annotations

By default, if neither of the annotations are present on a resource, the resource will be included.

#### Optionally Exclude A Resource
`kots.io/exclude: <bool>`: When this is present and evaluates to `true`, the resource will not be included in the kustomization.yaml file and will not be written to disk.

#### Optionally Include A Resource
`kots.io/when: <bool>`: When this is present and evaluates to `false`, the resource will not be included in the kustomization.yaml file and will not be written to disk.


## Example

The following example includes a config option to select "embedded postgres" or "external postgres", and contains part of a statefulset definition for Postgres that optionally renders only when the "embedded_postgres" option is selected.

### Config

```yaml
apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
kind: Config
metadata:
  name: example-application
spec:
  groups:
    - name: database
      title: Database
      description: Database Options
      items:
        - name: postgres_type
          type: select_one
          title: Postgres
          default: embedded_postgres
          items:
            - name: embedded_postgres
              title: Embedded Postgres
            - name: external_postgres
              title: External Postgres
```

### Statefulset

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Statefulset
metadata:
  name: postgresql
  annotations:
    "kots.io/exclude": 'repl{{ ConfigOptionEquals "postgres_type" "embedded_postgres" }}'
  labels:
    app: postgresql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: postgresql
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: postgresql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: postgresql
        image: "postgres:9.6"
        imagePullPolicy: ""
...
```
