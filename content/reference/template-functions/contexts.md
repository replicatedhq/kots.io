[Template functions](/vendor/packaging/template-functions/) are grouped into different contexts, depending on the phase of the application lifecycle when the function is available and the context data that is provided. 
Static, Config, and License contexts are available everywhere, while kURL context functions are not available on the config page.

## Static Context
Template functions in the static context can be used in any YAML, at any time. 
The static context also includes the [Masterminds Sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) function library.

## Config Context
Template functions in the config context are available when rendering an application that has a config screen. 
At execution time, template functions in this context also can use the static context functions.

## License Context
Template functions in the license context have access to license and version data.
