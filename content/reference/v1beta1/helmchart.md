A KOTS HelmChart custom resource enables KOTS to process and deploy Helm charts as part of a Vendor distributed application [using the Replicated Helm installation for existing applications](/vendor/helm/using-replicated-helm-charts/) or [the native Helm installation for new applications](/vendor/helm/using-native-helm-charts/). 
HelmChart custom resources are required for KOTS to deploy Helm charts (but not necessary if only raw K8s manifests are being deployed). 
This spec references a required `.tgz` export of the Helm chart resources and provides the necessary instructions for processing and preparing the chart for deployment.

By default, the HelmChart CR uses the Replicated Helm installation, which uses KOTS to render and deploy Helm charts. For new installations, you can set `useHelmInstall: true` in the spec to use the native Helm installation.

**Deploying multiple instance of the same chart**:
Vendors must provide additional HelmChart CR for each instance of the chart that is to be deployed as part of the application. However, only one `.tgz` of the chart needs to be included in the release.


```yaml
apiVersion: kots.io/v1beta1
kind: HelmChart

  name: samplechart

  # chart identifies a matching chart from a .tgz
  chart:
    name: samplechart
    chartVersion: 3.1.7

  exclude: "repl{{ ConfigOptionEquals `include_chart` `include_chart_no`}}"

  # helmVersion identifies the Helm Version used to render the Chart. Default is v2.
  helmVersion: v2

  # useHelmInstall identifies whether this Helm chart will use the 
  # Replicated Helm installation (false) or native Helm installation (true). Default is false.
  # Native Helm installations are only available for Helm v3 charts.
  useHelmInstall: true

  # values are used in the customer environment, as a pre-render step
  # these values will be supplied to helm template
  values:
    postgresql:
      enabled: repl{{ ConfigOptionEquals `postgres_type` `embedded_postgres`}}

## chart

The `chart` key allows for a mapping between the data in this definition and the chart archive itself. 
More than one `kind: HelmChart` can reference a single chart archive, if different settings are needed.

### `chart.name`
The name of the chart. 
This must match the `name` field from a `Chart.yaml` in a `.tgz` chart archive that's also included in the release.

### `chart.chartVersion`
The version of the chart. 
This must match the `version` field from a `Chart.yaml` in a `.tgz` chart archive that's also included in the release.

## helmVersion

Identifies the Helm Version used to render the Chart. 
Acceptable values are `v2` or `v3`. `v2` is the default when no value is specified.

## values

The `values` key allows for values to be changed in the chart, or for a mapping between the [Replicated Config screen](/vendor/config/config-screen/) and the values. 
This makes it possible to use the config screen UI to control the Helm values.yaml.

The keys below `values` should map exactly to the keys in your `values.yaml`. 
Only include the keys that you wish to change, these will be merged with the `values.yaml` in the chart archive.

To exclude a value that's set in the `values.yaml`, set it equal to the string `"null"` (with quotes), in this section. 
For more options here, check out the [Helm pull request](https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/2648).

## exclude

The `exclude` attribute is a [template-parsable](/reference/template-functions/contexts/) value for making [optional charts](/vendor/helm/optional-charts). 
During [processing](/vendor/helm/helm-processing), KOTS will render this field and exclude the entire chart if the output of this field can be parsed as a boolean evaluating to `true`.

## optionalValues

The `optionalValues` array is provided for advanced use cases to make value overrides completely optional. 
Not all charts treat `""` and missing as the same value. 
If it's required to only optionally have a value set, and an empty string does not provide the same functionality as "not set", then use the values here.

See the guide for using [HelmChart optionalValues](/vendor/helm/optional-value-keys/).

### `optionalValues[].when`

The `when` field in `optionalValues` provides a string-based, [template-function-evaluated](/reference/template-functions/contexts/) method to defer evaluation of the conditional to render time in the customer environment.

## namespace

The `namespace` key allows for a chart to be installed in an alternate namespace. 
If left blank, the namespace will default to the one into which kotsadm is installed. 
If an alternate namespace is specified, it is required that the namespace exist or is included in your yaml spec.

## builder

The `builder` key allows for defaults that will be set when Replicated is creating airgapped packages. 
This is an opportunity to ensure that all YAML and images are rendered "on" so they are included.
