A KOTS snapshot supports any compatible [Velero storage provider](https://velero.io/docs/main/supported-providers/). 
The Admin Console has built-in support for configuring a NFS server, AWS, GCP, Azure and S3-Compatible object stores as destinations.

For embedded clusters, the Admin Console is pre-configured to store backups in the locally-provisioned object store. 
This is sufficient for rollbacks and downgrades, but not a suitable configuration for disaster recovery. 
Embedded cluster installations should visit the "Snapshots" page in the Admin Console and configure a storage destination that is external to the cluster.
