The Admin Console contains a user interface for configuring regular snapshots.

## Retention

The default retention period for snapshots is 1 month. 
Setting the retention only affects snapshots created after the time of the change. 
For example, if an existing snapshot had a retention of 1 year and is already 6 months old, and a user then uses the UI to change the retention to 1 month, the existing snapshot will still be around for another 6 months.
