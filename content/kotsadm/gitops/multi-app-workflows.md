title: Pushing Updates to a GitOps Workflow in Multi App Mode

While the Admin Console is initially configured to receive updates, show the changes and deploy them to the cluster, this process can be changed and converted to use a GitOps workflow instead.
When using a GitOps workflow, changes from the Admin Console (config changes, upstream updates, license updates) will be pushed to a private Git repository, where an existing CI/CD process can execute to deliver the manifests to the cluster.

To begin migrating to a GitOps deployment workflow:

1. Click the GitOps link at the top of the Admin Console, then click **Get started**.  The GitOps Provider page will open.

    The GitOps Provider page opens.

1. Choose the Git provider and hostname (if applicable), then click  **Finish GitOps setup**.

    A screen displaying all of your apps with the status of GitOps integration for each app will show up next.

1. Click the **Enable** button next to the app you want to enable GitOps for.

    You'll be taken to the GitOps settings page for that app.

1. On the GitOps  setting page:

    1. Enter the repo details, and optionally branch and path to commit to in the repo.

    1. Select the action to take when there's an update. The Admin Console can create a new commit to the branch specified.

    1. On this page, there's an option to choose what type of asset to deliver to the git repo. Selecting **Rendered YAML** will result in a single, multi-doc YAML file being committed to the repo.

1. When GitOps is set up, the **GitOps** tab will contain a public deploy key. The private key will be stored securely in the Admin Console. Add the deploy key to the repo, and verify that the Admin Console can connect by clicking **Try again**.

    When the Admin Console establishes a connection to the repo, the following screen will be displayed.

## First commits

After converting to GitOps, the Admin Console will make a commit/pull request with the current version that's **Deployed**.
Then, it will make separate commits (or a single pull request) with any pending updates that have not been deployed from the Admin Console.
