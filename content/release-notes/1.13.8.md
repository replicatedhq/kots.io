{{<fixes>}}
* Fixed a bug that would cause subsequent updates in the Admin Console to fail if a previous release failed to upload to the internal object store (Minio, Rook, S3).
* Template functions in Preflight checks were not being rendered properly before execution.
* Fixed a bug that caused updates to fail if they did not contain a kots.io/v1beta1, Kind=Config document.
* Expanding deeply nested subdirectories within the View Files tab caused parent directories to be collapsed.
