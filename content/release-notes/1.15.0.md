{{<features>}}
* Added support for including snapshots (backup and restore) to an application by including a [Velero](https://velero.netlify.app) Backup spec. Documentation is available at https://kots.io/vendor/snapshots/overview/.
* The Admin Console can now include [custom redactors](https://troubleshoot.sh/reference/redactors/overview/) to be applied to all support bundles that are generated.
* When installing using `kots install`, it’s possible to supply config values via a `--config-values` flag to automate an online installation
* When downloading using `kots download`, it’s possible to get the password values in plain text when using a `--decrypt-password-values` flag ([#451](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots/issues/451)).
* When `kots upload` receives a file in `upstream/userdata/config.yaml` that contains plainText fields, if the matching config item is a password type, the plainText field will be encrypted and saved.
* Added a new kURL add-on to specify SELinux config.
* Added the ability to include a Docker daemon.json in a kURL spec.
* Added a new kURL add-on to specify a firewalld config.
* kURL supports local YAML patches for customers to override (or add) custom settings.
* Added the ability to upload a .RLI file (Replicated Classic) to the Admin Console. 
When this happens, the RLI file will be exchanged for a valid YAML file (KOTS License). 
Please contact us to enable this feature.

{{<changes>}}
* The diff calculation in the Admin Console now shows a diff of the output of `kustomize build`, not the full directory. 
This makes the diff view show only the changes that will be applied.
* Changed how `kots install` works when a `--license-file` flag is provided. 
It now just hands off the license file for the Admin Console to complete, causing the behavior of install with/without this field to be closer ([#450](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots/issues/450)).
* Update sprig template function library to 3.1.0 (see [corresponding release notes](https://github.com/Masterminds/sprig/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)).
* Changed default of `kots download` to be the current directory instead of the home directory ([#436](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots/issues/436)).
* Removed `--dest` flag from recommend `kots download` command on the View Files tab of the Admin Console.
* Added a timestamp to the support bundle rows on the Troubleshoot page.
* Removed the Copyright Replicated notice from the bottom of the Admin Console.
* When using the kURL embedded cluster and the customer passes a local patch yaml, both files will be stored in the cluster as `apiVersion: installers.kurl.sh/v1beta1, kind: Installer` objects.
* All Admin Console objects are annotated with velero annotations now.

* Fixed a panic that caused status informers to incorrectly report the status of the application as missing.
* Fixed a bug that was causing `kots upstream` commands to fail with 500 errors ([#473](https://github.com/replicatedhq/kots/issues/473)).
