> New installations of this KOTS version into non-airgapped existing clusters may fail due to removal of a needed MinIO image from DockerHub. This issue only impacts KOTS v1.41.1 to v1.43.1. We recommend upgrading to KOTS v1.43.2 or higher. 

{{<features>}}
* Added experimental support for multiple applications for a single customer under a consolidated license. This feature is experimental, and only available to vendors who have requested access.
{{</features>}}

{{<changes>}}
* KOTS will detect if a user has insufficient privileges to KOTS install/upgrade and print an error message. Please reference [KOTS RBAC](/vendor/packaging/rbac/).
* New `kots reset-tls` [CLI command](/kots-cli/reset-tls) is available. If a bad TLS certificate is uploaded to the Admin Console or the kotsadm-tls secret is missing, the `kots reset-tls` command will reapply a default self-signed TLS certificate.

{{<fixes>}}
* Fixed a bug that caused images to be pulled from the internet instead of the private on-prem registry when an anonymous registry was used.
* Fixed a bug that caused a kurl proxy unavailable error when a bad TLS certificate/key was uploaded.
