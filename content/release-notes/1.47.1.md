* Fixed a bug where the `reset-tls` command would not restart the kurl-proxy-kotsadm pod.
* Fixed a bug where using the `--ensure-rbac=false` flag with [install](/kots-cli/install/) and [upgrade](/kots-cli/admin-console/upgrade/) commands would still attempt to modify RBAC objects.
* Fixed a bug where a deployment would fail if the same resource is included in different [Helm charts](/vendor/helm/using-helm-charts/).
