{{<fixes>}}
* Fixed a bug that caused KOTS to fail to detect [private images](/vendor/packaging/private-images/#replicated-private-registry) if their domains are blocked by a firewall in online installs.
* Fixed a bug that caused the [set config](/kots-cli/set/config/) command to fail if an appliction config has a required password value that was already set.
* Fixed a bug that caused the [LocalImageName](/reference/template-functions/config-context/#localimagename) function to not require private images when `proxyPublicImages` is set.
* Fixed a bug that could cause the secret used to pull private images to be removed during a [KOTS Snapshot](/kotsadm/snapshots/overview/) restore when multiple applications are installed.
* Fixed a bug that could cause [Helm render](/vendor/helm/helm-processing/) on a chart using the API to be not supported by the target kubernetes cluster.
* Fixed a bug that caused newer style charts with private images failed to kustomize.
* Fixed a bug that caused coexistence of legacy and newer style charts with private images failed to deploy.
