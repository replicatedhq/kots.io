> New installations of this KOTS version into non-airgapped existing clusters may fail due to removal of a needed MinIO image from DockerHub. This issue only impacts KOTS v1.41.1 to v1.43.1. We recommend upgrading to KOTS v1.43.2 or higher. 

{{<changes>}}
* Updated MinIO image to RELEASE.2021-05-11T23-27-41Z.
* Installs to OpenShift 4.2 and later will now use Alpine based Postgres image.
{{</changes>}}

{{<fixes>}}
* Fixed an issue that would cause support bundles generated from the KOTS Admin Console for embedded kURL clusters to omit cluster resources for all namespaces other than default.
* Fixed an issue that would cause displayed redactions to be from the wrong support bundle.
{{</fixes>}}
