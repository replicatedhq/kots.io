Fixed by ensuring that any configuration change applies to all available releases for upgrade, not just the latest.

* Better error messaging when detecting invalid ConfigItem template usage.
* Fixed a bug that caused the internal use of Kustomize to fail when a manifest specified a static namespace.
* Support bundle command now works from the host on embedded online installs.

* [License](https://kots.io/reference/template-functions/license-context/) template functions now work on the config screen.
