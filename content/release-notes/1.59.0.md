{{<features>}}
* Adds the `kubectl kots get config` command to export config values. This includes a `--decrypt` flag to decrypt sensitive values.
* The internal storage location for snapshots now uses a persistent volume instead of object storage when the `disableS3` flag is set to `true` for embedded clusters. For more information about removing KOTS use of object storage, see the [kURL add-on documentation](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/kotsadm).

{{<changes>}}

{{<fixes>}}
* Fixes a bug that caused analyzers to surface errors in namespaces not used by the application when the admin console has cluster access in existing cluster installations.
* Fixes an issue that caused image pull secrets to be rendered in the admin console namespace instead of the `namespace` specified in the kots.io/v1beta1.HelmChart when using `useHelmInstall`.
* Fixes the `kots pull` CLI command to properly inject `imagePullSecrets` when using Helm Charts with `useHelmInstall` set to `true`.
* Fixes a bug that causes application images to not be deleted from a [private registry](/kotsadm/registries/kurl-registry/).
* Fixes a bug that causes images included in support bundle's [`run` collector](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/collect/run/#image-required) to not be deleted from a private registry.
