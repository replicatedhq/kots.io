> New installations of this KOTS version into non-airgapped existing clusters may fail due to removal of a needed MinIO image from DockerHub. This issue only impacts KOTS v1.41.1 to v1.43.1. We recommend upgrading to KOTS v1.43.2 or higher.

* Fixed a bug that caused KOTS Snapshots destinations to not be shown when velero images are pushed to a private registry that contains a port number.
