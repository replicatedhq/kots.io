{{<features>}}
* Added support for a new `additionalNamespaces` field in the `apiVersion: k8s.io/v1beta1, Kind=Application` manifest.
* Added a `requireMinimimalRBAC` field in the `apiVersion: k8s.io/v1beta1, Kind=Application` manifest. 
When enabled and running `kots install`, KOTS will default to a namespaced-scoped RBAC role instead of a cluster-scoped role.
* Added a new `Distribution` template function to return a string indicating the managed Kubernetes offering (i.e. `openshift`, `eks`, etc).
* Added a new [kURL Context](/reference/template-functions/kurl-context) and corresponding template functions to read 
values from the kURL Installer CRD. 
These functions are not available on the config page.
{{</features>}}

{{<changes>}}
* Changed the internal API that `kots upload` and `kots download` use to the Go API. 
The Typescript implementations are deprecated.
* Added Velero status to the dashboard tile to identify if Velero is not installed and Snapshots are enabled.
* When running the Admin Console port forward (after `kots install` or `kots admin-console`), if port 8800 is not available, a random port will be used instead of showing an error.
* Default support bundle collectors now include rook, ceph, and kURL information.
* Removed the `allowSnapshots` flag from the `kots.io/v1beta1/Appplication` resource. 
Snapshots are now enabled by including a `velero.io/v1/Backup` resource in a release.
