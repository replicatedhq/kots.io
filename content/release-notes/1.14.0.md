{{<features>}}
* Added support for a new `additionalNamespaces` field in the `apiVersion: k8s.io/v1beta1, Kind=Application` manifest.
* Added a `requireMinimimalRBAC` field in the `apiVersion: k8s.io/v1beta1, Kind=Application` manifest. When enabled and running `kots install`, KOTS will default to a namespaced-scoped RBAC role instead of a cluster-scoped role.
* Added a new `Distribution` template function to return a string indicating the managed Kubernetes offering (i.e. `openshift`, `eks`, etc).
{{</features>}}

{{<changes>}}
* Changed the internal API that `kots upload` and `kots download` use to the Go API. The Typescript implementations are deprecated.
* Added Velero status to the dashboard tile to identify if Velero is not installed and Snapshots are enabled.
* When running the Admin Console port forward (after `kots install` or `kots admin-console`), if port 8800 is not available, a random port will be used instead of showing an error.
* Default support bundle collectors now include rook, ceph, and kurl information.
* kotsadm-api is given ClusterRole access by default.
