{{<features>}}
* Added the ability to opt-in to removing the MinIO object store dependency for `hostpath` and `nfs` snapshot options for [kURL embedded](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/kots#advanced-install-options) and [existing cluster](/kotsadm/updating/updating-admin-console/#online-installations) upgrades. The opt-in flags for this feature is the same as those introduced in [KOTS 1.47.0](/release-notes/#1470) to remove KOTS' dependency on Minio for application archives and support bundles. This feature leverages a new Velero plugin, [`local-volume-provider`](https://github.com/replicatedhq/local-volume-provider), to provide file system backups. For existing offline clusters, customers will need to [add this plugin to velero](https://github.com/replicatedhq/local-volume-provider) prior to migration or installation. If this opt-in is selected as part of the upgrade, KOTS will attempt reconfigure Velero to use the new provider. Data is neither deleted nor copied from the filesystem during the migration, but the migration process is irreversible. This option is also available for new KOTS installs on [kURL embedded](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/kots#advanced-install-options) and [existing clusters](https://kots.io/kotsadm/installing/online-install/#kots-install). When specified on new installs, MinIO will not be used by KOTS for filesystem snapshots.
* Added an output flag to [KOTS CLI](/kots-cli/getting-started/) that provides a JSON formatted object to the following CLI commands: kots backup, restore, download, upload, upstream upgrade, and version.
