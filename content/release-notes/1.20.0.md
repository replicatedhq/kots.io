{{<features>}}
* Added ability to delete disconnected nodes from the cluster management page of the Admin Console on embedded clusters.
* Added template function support in [Collect](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/collect/), [Analyze](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/analyze/), and [SupportBundle](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/support-bundle/collecting/) specs.
* Added [template functions](/reference/template-functions/license-context/) for Sequence, Cursor, ChannelName, VersionLabel, ReleaseNotes, and IsAirgap.
* Added support for automated (unattended, headless) upgrades of applications installed into airgapped instances using [KOTS CLI](/kots-cli/upstream/upgrade/).
* Added support for automated (unattended, headless) installs of applications into an embedded cluster (both airgap and online) using [KOTS CLI](/kotsadm/installing/installing-embedded-cluster/).
* Private images used by SupportBundle and Preflight [collectors](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/collect/collectors/) are now automatically rewritten so they can be pulled from inside the cluster and are included in airgap bundles.
{{</features>}}

{{<changes>}}
* Added support for Kubernetes 1.19 and dropped support for Kubernetes 1.16.
* Updated design of [Version History](/kotsadm/updating/updating-kots-apps/#checking-for-updates) page.
* Updated design of the version card on the application dashboard.
  - Latest available version information is shown in the card.
  - Check for updates button is always available.
  - Current deployment status is included.
* Added resource limits and requests for Admin Console pods.
* Admin Consoles will use `NODE_PORT` environment variable if set (e.g. from kURL embedded clusters), instead of the default 8800.
* Port forwarding no longer uses the `app.k8s.io/v1beta1` Application spec and has been aligned with the [documentation](/vendor/config/dashboard-buttons/#additional-ports-and-port-forwarding).
* [SupportBundle](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/support-bundle/collecting/) and [Preflight](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/preflight/introduction/) specs are no longer served on unauthenticated endpoints and instead are provided to [support-bundle and preflight binaries](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/#installation) via [secrets](/kotsadm/troubleshooting/support-bundle/).
* The version check endpoint now correctly reports the current application version and adds information about KOTS Admin Console version, Kubernetes version, app status, etc.
