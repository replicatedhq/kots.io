{{<features>}}
* Permanently enables the redesigned admin console app dashboard and version history pages introduced in [KOTS 1.60.0](/release-notes/1.60.0/).
* Application versions that fail to download now appear in the version history. A new button is also present with the version to allow the download to be retried. Previously, these failures were lost when a newer version was downloaded successfully.
* Introduces the [`kots upstream download`](/kots-cli/upstream/download) command to retry downloading a failed update of the upstream application.
{{</features>}}

{{<changes>}}
* The port-forward initiated to access the admin console will continually retry when it is disconnected. If a new kotsadm pod comes up, the port forward will switch and forward to the new pod.
* If the `kots` CLI version doesn't match the KOTS API version in the cluster, a warning message is displayed advising the user to update the `kots` CLI to the appropriate version.
{{</changes>}}

{{<fixes>}}
* Fixes uploading preflight results from the CLI.
* Fixes a bug where the app icon in the metadata would not show as the favicon in Google Chrome.
