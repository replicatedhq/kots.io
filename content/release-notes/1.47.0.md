{{<features>}}
* Adds the ability to opt-in to removing the MinIO object store dependency for KOTS for [kURL embedded](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/kotsadm#advanced-install-options) and [existing cluster](https://kots.io/kotsadm/updating/updating-admin-console/#online-installations) upgrades. If this opt-in is selected as part of the upgrade, KOTS migrates all application archives and support bundles to a blob/filesystem that is part of the new KOTS admin console `statefulset`. The migration process is irreversible. This option is also available for new KOTS installations on [kURL embedded](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/kotsadm#advanced-install-options) and [existing clusters](https://kots.io/kotsadm/installing/online-install/#kots-install). When specified on new installations, MinIO is not used by KOTS for application archive or support bundle storage.
* Adds a config option for repeatable items. This allows for more than one value to be provided under a single config item. The config item targets a YAML array or YAML file, which is duplicated and rendered for as many values as are provided.
* Adds experimental support for a new Helm rendering workflow that supports hook and hook weight for v3 Helm charts. The new workflow applies to the following hooks: pre-install, post-install, pre-upgrade, post-upgrade. This feature is experimental and only available to vendors who have requested access.
