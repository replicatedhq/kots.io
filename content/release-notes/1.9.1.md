{{<features>}}
- Added a new `--deploy` to the `kots upstream upgrade` command. 
When specified, kots CLI automatically deploys the latest version in addition to downloading it.
- Improved addition of image pull secrets to jobs and other objects. Previous releases would add the image pull secret too often, causing a job object to unecessarily change.
