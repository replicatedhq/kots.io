{{<fixes>}}
* Fixed a bug that caused configuring [Network File System (NFS)](/kotsadm/snapshots/configuring-nfs/) or [Host Path](/kotsadm/snapshots/configuring-hostpath/) as a snapshots [storage destination](/kotsadm/snapshots/storage-destinations/) to fail the first time if the default bucket does not exist.
