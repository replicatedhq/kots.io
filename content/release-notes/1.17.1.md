{{<fixes>}}
* Fixed a bug where after generating a new support bundle using the Analyze button on the Troubleshoot page, the user is redirected to a previous bundle.
* Fixed a bug where having wrapped lines in the KOTS [Config.yaml](https://kots.io/reference/v1beta1/config/) file resulted in KOTS falsely reporting the release `Contains invalid yaml` on the version history page.
