{{<fixes>}}
* Fixed issue that caused the Admin Console to crash when checking for updates if the installed app did not have a previous configuration saved. 
* Fixed a bug that prevented fetching updates when a license update was pending. 
Now, the license will be synced, and then updates will be fetched.
