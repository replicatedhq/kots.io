{{<features>}}
* Added the ability to view some detailed information (such as logs, events, etc.) for each unhealthy pod, in the "Support bundle analysis" view under the "Troubleshoot" tab in the admin console.
{{</features>}}

{{<changes>}}
* KOTS resources now provide an explicit security context per pod and container, along with a seccomp profile (`runtime/default`). This allows for policy validation through tools such as [OPA Gatekeeper](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/). KOTS containers use a read-only root filesystem, do not run as the root user or group, and do not require privileged escalation.
* Added more default analyzers for Kubernetes objects.
{{</changes>}}

{{<fixes>}}
* Fixed a bug that caused Weave analyzers to show Weave errors on installs that don't use Weave.
* Fixed a bug that masked the "License expired" message when sharing a support bundle with a vendor.
* Fixed a bug on the admin console license page where the ["Sync License"](/kotsadm/updating/license-updates/#syncing-the-license) button was misaligned.
