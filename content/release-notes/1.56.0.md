{{<features>}}
* Added the ability to view some detailed information (such as logs, events, etc...) for each unhealthy pod under the "Support bundle analysis" view under the "Troubleshoot" tab in the admin console.
{{</features>}}

{{<changes>}}
* KOTS resources now provide an explicit security context per pod and container, along with a seccomp profile (`runtime/default`). 
This allows for policy validation through tools such as [OPA Gatekeeper](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/).
KOTS containers do not run as the root user or group, use a read-only root filesystem and doe not require privledged escalation.
* Added more default analyzers for Kubernetes objects.
{{</changes>}}

{{<fixes>}}
* Fixed a bug that caused Weave analyzers show Weave errors on installs that don't use Weave.
* Fixed a bug that masked the "License expired" message when sharing support bundle with vendor.
* Fixed a bug in the Admin Console license page where the ["Sync License"](/kotsadm/updating/license-updates/#syncing-the-license) button was misaligned.
