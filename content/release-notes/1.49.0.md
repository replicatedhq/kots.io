* The [kots pull](/kots-cli/pull/) and [kots admin-console generate-manifests](/kots-cli/admin-console/generate-manifests/) commands will now save the manifests in the current working directory by default.
* Updated the warning message printed by the [kots install](/kots-cli/install/) command when KOTS fails to pull the application metadata to mention that it could also cause the Admin Console to run without minimal role-based-access-control (RBAC) privileges, which may be required by the application.
* The `--kotsadm-namespace` flag is now optional in existing-cluster airgapped installations for the [kots upstream upgrade](/kots-cli/upstream/) command as well, and its value can be concatenated to the `--kotsadm-registry` flag instead (same as the [kots install](/kots-cli/install/) command).

* Fixed a bug that caused the existing cluster workflow to show in an embedded environment if user logged out before finishing app setup.
* Fixed a bug that made it possible to install the same license multiple times using automated installs.
* Fixed a bug that caused KOTS to not be able to detect the application spec (along with other KOTS kinds) if it's part of a multi-yaml document, which for example caused status informers to be ignored in that case.
