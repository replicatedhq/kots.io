{{<features>}}
 * Added the ability to force [image garbage collection](/kots-cli/admin-console/garbage-collect-images/) via the KOTS CLI even if rollback is enabled for the application by passing the `--ignore-rollback` flag.
{{</features>}}

{{<changes>}}
 * KOTS can now successfully [install](/kots-cli/install/) and [upgrade](/kots-cli/admin-console/upgrade/) when [`readOnlyRootFilesystem`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) is enforced in an existing cluster.
{{</changes>}}

{{<fixes>}}
 * Fixed a beta Helm hooks bug where resources failed to pull images if the resource had a negative Hook Weight value.
 * Fixed a bug that caused image garbage collection to fail on embedded clusters.
 * Fixed a bug that caused collecting [cluster resources](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/collect/cluster-resources/) for the support bundle to fail in installations that require minimal RBAC priviliges.
 * Fixed a bug that caused applications with an image pull secret name hardcoded as `kotsadm-replicated-registry` to fail to deploy.
