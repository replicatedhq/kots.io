{{<features>}}
 * KOTS will successfully [install](/kots-cli/install/)/[upgrade](/kots-cli/admin-console/upgrade/) when `readOnlyRootFilesystem` is specified in an existing cluster.
 * Added the ability to force [image garbage collection](/kots-cli/admin-console/garbage-collect-images/) via the KOTS CLI even if rollback is enabled for the application by passing the `--ignore-rollback` flag.
{{</features>}}

{{<fixes>}}
 * Fixed a Helm hooks bug where resources failed to pull images if the resource had a negative Hook Weight value.
 * Fixed a bug that caused image garbage collection to not work on embedded clusters.
 * Fixed a bug that caused collecting [cluster resources](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/collect/cluster-resources/) for the support bundle to fail in installations that require minimal RBAC priviliges.
 * Fixed a bug that caused applications with hardcoded `kotsadm-replicated-registry` image pull secret name to fail to deploy.
