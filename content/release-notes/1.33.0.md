{{<features>}}
* KOTS Snapshots now supports [Network File System (NFS)](/kotsadm/snapshots/configuring-nfs/) and [Host Path](/kotsadm/snapshots/configuring-hostpath/) as two additional [storage destination](/kotsadm/snapshots/storage-destinations/) options.
{{</features>}}

{{<changes>}}
* Application Config form under the config tab now has a min and max width to better maintain spacing on the page.
* Upgraded [Helm v3](/vendor/helm/using-helm-charts/) dependency from v3.2.4 to v3.5.2.
* Added instrumentation for preflight usage.
{{</changes>}}

{{<fixes>}}
* Fixed a bug where boolean custom fields were not displayed properly on the [license page](/kotsadm/updating/license-updates/).
* Fixed a bug where the wrong page title was shown on the [Cluster Management](/vendor/guides/ha-guide/#adding-remaining-nodes-to-cluster) page. 
* Fixed a bug where conditional config items would show up on the navigation tree even when they are hidden in the main config. Now Application Config groups that have a conditional 'when' value or that have been set to 'hidden' will be hidden in the sidebar when necessary.
* Fixed a bug where the Admin Console could hang if you attempted to upgrade KOTS when the latest was already running. 
* Fixed a bug that could cause documents to get ignored in Helm Charts.
* Removed duplicate secrets while generating [support bundle](/kotsadm/troubleshooting/support-bundle/).
