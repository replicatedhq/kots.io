{{<fixes>}}
* Fixed a bug where objects with the same kubernetes group, version, kind and name would be treated as referring to the same object, even if they were in different namespaces. 
Kots now properly identifies objects in different namespaces as being distinct.
* Fixed an issue where some kotsadm support bundle files would be included within `kots/admin_console`. 
They are now properly included within `kots/admin-console`.
* Fixed a bug that caused `kots install` with the `--license-file` parameter specified to fail silently.
* Fixed a bug that caused support bundles to not be generated when snapshots fail.
