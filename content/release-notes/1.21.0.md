{{<changes>}}
* Support bundle files will now be saved under a subdirectory, so that it won't pollute the current directory when extracted.
* Rolling back to a version with known invalid files will show a "Invalid files" modal first before deploying.
{{</changes>}}

{{<fixes>}}
* Fixed a bug that caused rolling back to a previously failed deploy to still show the status as "failed" after a successful rollback.
* Fixed an issue where the redacted file did not scroll into view when selected from the "Redactor report" tab in troubleshoot.
