{{<changes>}}
* If the [Goldpinger add-on](https://kurl.sh/docs/add-ons/goldpinger) is included with kURL, the KOTS support bundle will now include data collected and analyzed by Goldpinger, which helps identify in-cluster network connectivity issues. 
* Improved visibility that GitOps is enabled when on the Version History page in Admin Console.

{{<fixes>}}
* Replaced "Continue editing" button with "Edit latest config" button on the [Config page](/kotsadm/installing/online-install/#config-screen) to ensure users are able to continue editing rather than remaining on a read-only config screen.
