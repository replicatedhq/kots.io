* Fixed a bug on the [License page](https://kots.io/kotsadm/updating/license-updates/) where large license fields extend off the browser screen.
* Fixed a bug where the Application dashboard "Start a snapshot" link didn't create the correct snapshot if you clicked on "Learn More" first.
* Fixed a bug that caused velero filesystem cli commands to log the progress even if the output format was specified, which used to break automation.
