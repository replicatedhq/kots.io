{{<fixes>}}
* Fixed issue that prevented deployment of anything other than the latest version in the Admin Console. Clicking the 'deploy' button next to an older version in the Admin Console will now correctly deploy that version, instead of always deploying the latest version.
* Fixed UI issue preventing all airgap bundle uploads from the dashboard. Uploads on the 'Version History' page were not affected.
* Addressed layout issues on the Admin Console dashboard that appeared if there were any errors reported during airgap package upload.
