{{<features>}}
* Adds [`targetKotsVersion`](/reference/v1beta1/application/#targetkotsversion) as a field in the application spec. This field allows you to set a target version of KOTS for a release. The initial installation of an application will fail if the currently installed KOTS version is greater than the target version. When a target version is set, end users will receive a notification in the admin console if their currently deployed version of KOTS is less than the target version. For more informaiton, see the documentation.
  
* Adds [`minKotsVersion`](/reference/v1beta1/application/#minkotsversion-beta) (Beta) as a field in the application spec. This allows you to specify the minimum supported KOTS version for a release. An application cannot be installed if the currently deployed KOTS version is less than the minimum KOTS version specified for a release. See the [`minKotsVersion` documentation](/reference/v1beta1/application/#minkotsversion-beta) for caveats since this is a Beta feature.
