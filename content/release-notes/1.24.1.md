{{<fixes>}}
* Fixed a bug that caused applications that use [operators](https://kots.io/vendor/operators/packaging-an-operator/) fail to deploy on the first attempt due to missing CRDs, unless the CRD version was `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1`.
Now any version that begins with `apiextensions.k8s.io/` will be recognized.
* Fixed a bug that caused [kubectlVersion](https://kots.io/reference/v1beta1/application/#kubectlversion) to be ignored, unless it was `1.14.x` or `1.16.x`.
