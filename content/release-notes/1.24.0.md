{{<features>}}
* Added [a command](https://kots.io/kots-cli/remove/) that allows removing application references from dashboard.
* [Support bundle collected from Admin Console](https://kots.io/kotsadm/troubleshooting/support-bundle/) will now include a go-routine profile.
{{</features>}}

{{<changes>}}
* The same license can no longer be installed twice on the same Admin Console instance.
* [Pull policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/overview/#container-images) for Admin Console images has been changed from `Always` to `IfNotPresent` to account for new rate limits enforced by [Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/).
* [License page](https://kots.io/kotsadm/updating/license-updates/) has been improved to better highlight application features.
* Removed support for [Kustomize 2.0.3](https://kots.io/reference/v1beta1/application/#kubectlversion).
{{</changes>}}

{{<fixes>}}
* Fixed a bug that caused [`kots admin-console push-images`](https://kots.io/kotsadm/installing/airgap-packages/#kots-install) command to fail when secret ID and secret key are used for authentication with ECR.
* Fixed a bug that caused errors to not be surfaced to the user on the Snapshots page.
* Fixed a bug that caused a compatibility warning to be shown on the Snapshots page if Velero 1.5.2 is installed, which is fully supported.
