{{<features>}}
 * [Installing with Native Helm](/vendor/helm/using-native-helm-charts/) is now generally available (GA). This workflow provides the ability to have the admin console work directly with Helm to install and manage chart resources, including support with most Helm hooks and weights. The existing workflow with Helm has been renamed to [Installing with Replicated KOTS](/vendor/helm/using-replicated-helm-charts/) and is still available for use. Any charts currently deployed to application instances will be unaffected by this change, however any new charts are eligible to use the [Native Helm](/vendor/helm/using-native-helm-charts/) workflow.
