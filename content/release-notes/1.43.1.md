> New installations of this KOTS version into non-airgapped existing clusters may fail due to removal of a needed MinIO image from DockerHub. This issue only impacts KOTS v1.41.1 to v1.43.1. We recommend upgrading to KOTS v1.43.2 or higher. 

{{<changes>}}
* When the `--skip-preflights` flag is used with the [`kots install`](/kots-cli/install/) command, the KOTS Admin UI will now show a `Checks skipped` status in Version History.

{{<fixes>}}
* Fixed a bug that could cause ClusterRoles to be created in namespace scoped environment when [upgrading Admin Console](/kots-cli/admin-console/upgrade/).
* Fixed a bug that caused release notes to not be shown when the application is [installed from an airgap bundle](/kotsadm/installing/airgap-packages/).
* Fixed a bug that caused the Preflight Checks screen in the KOTS Admin UI to be stuck on a progress bar indefinitely when the `--skip-prefligths` flag was used with the [`kots install`](/kots-cli/install/) command.
* Fixed a bug that caused the cursor to block user input on the interactive shell interface of the [`kots install`](/kots-cli/install/) command.
* Fixed a bug that caused [airgap bundle upload](/kotsadm/installing/airgap-packages/#upload-airgap-bundle) to fail with anonymous private registries.
* Fixed a bug that would allow an application with newly required configurations to be deployed with those required configurations missing when the `--deploy` flag was used with the [`kots upstream upgrade`](/kots-cli/upstream/upgrade/) command.
