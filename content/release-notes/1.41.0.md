{{</features>}}

{{<changes>}}
* Clicking on the Application menu `Config` tab now navigates to the deployed config instead of latest release version config if those are not the same.

* Changed the spinner to a progress bar while generating a support bundle for an application.
{{</changes>}}

{{<fixes>}}
* Updating [KOTS Snapshot settings](/kotsadm/snapshots/storage-destinations/) will now wait for Velero and Restic to start running before showing the success message. Additionally, error feedback was improved to differentiate between `Velero is not installed` and `Velero is not ready` as the pod is being spun up.
* Fixed a CSS bug that caused the selected state of a boxed checkbox item to have the wrong color background.
{{</fixes>}}
