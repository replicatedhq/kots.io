{{<features>}}
* New design for [application configuration](/kotsadm/installing/online-install/#config-screen) screen that allows easy navigation to different sections of the configuration. This feature requires no change to existing configuration. It leverages any existing Groups and Items hierarchy in the current [config](/reference/v1beta1/config/).
{{</features>}}

{{<changes>}}
* Updated links to version configuration to indicate whether config is read-only or editable.
* Improvements to memory and disk usage when [airgap bundles are being uploaded](/kotsadm/installing/airgap-packages/#upload-airgap-bundle).
* Troubleshoot ([support bundle and analyzers](/kotsadm/troubleshooting/support-bundle/)) has been upgraded to v0.10.7.
* Added helper text to replace default external documentation links where possible to better support airgap and white labeling use cases.

{{<fixes>}}
* Fixed a bug that allowed editing read-only fields on the [application config screen](/kotsadm/installing/online-install/#config-screen).
* Fixed a bug that caused viewing the list of [Full Snapshots](/kotsadm/snapshots/overview/#full-snapshots-recommended) in the Admin Console to fail if one of the snapshots contains an app that no longer exists.
